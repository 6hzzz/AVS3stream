## AVS3 Streams
This is a collection of sample bitstreams for AVS3-P2 baseline profile. These bitstreams were generated by [uavs3e](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e.git), and could be decoded using [uavs3d](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3d.git)

## Usage
### Directory Structure
Test samples are placed in the directory like `mux/testing_name_M`. 

### Samples
The samples are named like `test.avs3` or `test.ts` in its directory.  For each sample,  the `md5` of the sample bitstream and the reconstruction YUV data is stored in `md5.txt` in the same directory.
